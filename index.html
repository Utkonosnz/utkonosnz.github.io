<center><h1>The Ballad of Robin Hood</h1></center>
<p>An entry in the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2875719/2022-solitaire-print-and-play-contest">2022 Solitaire Print and Play Contest</a>
run by Ben Moryata.</p>
<p>You can now play <i>The Ballad of Robin Hood</i> online (more or less). A PCIO file is available at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1-161jCaAYrwMcSRkdaqDJ1phFoyxh6NC">this link.</a>
</p>
<h2>Basic Rules</h2>
<p>The game takes place over 28 days. At the start of each day, roll on the Weather Table to determine the weather. Then, you take up to 3 actions. The possible actions are:
<ul>
<li><p>Move: move Robin and any other outlaws you wish from Robin's current hex to a neighbouring hex. For each outlaw moved, spend 1 FOOD
or lose 1 hit point (HP). If you have as many HORSES as outlaws moved, you may instead move two hexes away. After moving, if you entered a
Field or Forest hex, roll on the corresponding Encounter Table.</p>
<li><p>Special Action: Take an action from the Action Menu corresponding to your current location.</p>
</ul>
<p>This is enough to start playing the game! You may place Robin in any empty pale green hex to start. See the full rules (including a quick start guide) here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-161jCaAYrwMcSRkdaqDJ1phFoyxh6NC">Google doc</a>.
<h2>Tables</h2>
</p>Below you will find all the tables needed for the game. Clicking on a heading opens it. Clicking again collapses it.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you play a rule wrong here or there. The main aim of the game is to generate adventure stories, although your
ultimate goal is to gain as much FAME as possible.</p>
<p>Any feedback much appreciated!</p>
